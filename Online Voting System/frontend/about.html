              An online voting system that will replace the <br />old ballot
              sytem or paper system. Over the time <br />we have utilized the
              required technology in every<br />sector to improve efficiency and
              save the extra<br />resources. But the voting system is still very
              <br />expensive and requires a bigger workforce.<br />The system
              is slower and still not completely <br />tamper proof. We bring
              the system that is safe,<br />reliable and solve the modern issues
              like higher<br />reachability of the booth, crowd free voting,
              <br />inexpensive, faster results and others.
